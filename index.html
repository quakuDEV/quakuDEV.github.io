                        I can teach people well and have already began teaching a few people on how to code!
                        I teach people in a structured manner and provide exercises when needed.

                    <p>
                        I know every nook and cranny of python, as I have been studying it for a few years. It is my second most used programming language, and is crucial for both learning higher level languages and learning to be logical with code.
                        It is used my companies like Intel, Spotify, Facebook, JP Morgan Chase and Netflix.

                    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
                    <p>
                        I started learning JavaScript in a school-sanctioned coding club and from then began to learn more and more. I can code in this quite well now, and have taught someone this language before.

                    <p>
                        Lua is an easy to learn language, as it is close to english.
                        It does, however, have limited uses, particularly special for 'Roblox' games.
                        Lua has an alternative which is more specific for 'Roblox' called Luau, which I can also teach.

                    <p>
                        C# is a high-level programming language which can be used to make video games with high capabilities.
                        It is a bit harder than the others, but it is very rewarding and impressive to learn.
                        There are 2 other C-type programming languages called C and C++. I don't know these yet, however, but if needed, I can learn them as they have similar syntax to C#.                 </p>

                    <p>
                        SQL is used for server-management, and features as a part of our programming courses / lessons in most of the languages.
                        We won't learn this specifically, but I will teach it to you when learning how to program servers in other languages in order to perform actions in a server.

                        This pairs well with CSS, which can be used for styling a website.

                        Python is the main start of a career.
                        It is used by many big corporations and allows a user to make games and applications.
                        Although not the fastest, it is a great language to start getting serious.
                        JavaScript is an alternative, as it is also really good, but is a bit harder.

                        When getting really good, a programmer should switch to one of these to learn.
