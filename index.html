                    I am a tutor / programmer in many languages.
                    I have made a few projects which you can check out below!

                    <p>
                        I can teach people well and have already began teaching a few people on how to code!
                        I teach people in a structured manner and provide exercises when needed.

                        Behind the scenes, I pride myself on writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code. I have made many projects which include games, server management and algorithms.

                        I can both teach and code well. I can also code cleanly, allowing others to learn aswell. This is a very important skill as it allows programmers to work well and efficiently.

                    <p>
                        I know every nook and cranny of python, as I have been studying it for a few years. It is my second most used programming language, and is crucial for both learning higher level languages and learning to be logical with code.
                        It is used my companies like Intel, Spotify, Facebook, JP Morgan Chase and Netflix.

                    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
                    <p>
                        I started learning JavaScript in a school-sanctioned coding club and from then began to learn more and more. I can code in this quite well now, and have taught someone this language before.

                    <h1>Lua(u)</h1>
                    <p>
                        Lua is an easy to learn language, as it is close to english.
                        It does, however, have limited uses, particularly special for 'Roblox' games.
                        Lua has an alternative which is more specific for 'Roblox' called Luau, which I can also teach.

                    <p>
                        C# is a high-level programming language which can be used to make video games with high capabilities.
                        It is a bit harder than the others, but it is very rewarding and impressive to learn.
                        There are 2 other C-type programming languages called C and C++. I don't know these yet, however, but if needed, I can learn them as they have similar syntax to C#.                 </p>

                    <h1>SQL</h1>
                    <p>
                        SQL is used for server-management, and features as a part of our programming courses / lessons in most of the languages.
                        We won't learn this specifically, but I will teach it to you when learning how to program servers in other languages in order to perform actions in a server.

                    <p>
                        JSON is a language used for API work and storing data as key-value pairs. It is very useful for programming and even coding games!
